      <p>I'm 26 and I'm the oldest of five children (in the picture, I'm the second from right to left)</p>
      <p>I served as a missionary in Chile Concepcion South Mission three years ago, a place I'll treasure my whole life.</p>
      <p>My degree is Applied Technology, and I want to make focus on the Design area.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm working as a User Experience Designer (aka UX Designer), and is a job I completely enjoy.</p>
      <p>I'm still learning, and I'm sure this course will provide me more meaningful tools to apply there.</p>
